# 24hoursOfBaby

24 Hours of Baby is a game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It simulates taking care of an infant in the first few weeks after birth. Scores are persisted in a learning record score (LRS) and retreived using the xAPI to populate a leaderboard that compares a player's score with top scores from the last 30 days.
